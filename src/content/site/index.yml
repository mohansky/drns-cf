      comments: Doctor was very friendly and caring. I took my dad for consultation after coronary angiogram which was suggested by the same doctor. He ensured all the procedures are done properly and explained in detail about the whole process very patiently. Thank you doctor.

      treatment: Cardiac checkup - General
      comments: Very professional approach by the doctor. Went for a check up since I had chest pain. He did an ECG, ECHO and TMT and reassured me that my heart is fine. I am very happy with the doctor. His support staff especially Nanditha are also excellent. Also need to add that his fees and other charges are reasonable. Highly recommended.
