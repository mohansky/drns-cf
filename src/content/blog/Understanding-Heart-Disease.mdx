coverAlt: "A stethoscope resting on a medical chart with a heart diagram."
excerpt: "Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, but many risk factors are within our control. At our clinic, we believe education is the first step toward prevention. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are three key risk factors that contribute to heart disease. Nearly half of Americans have at least one of these conditions. Other major factors include diabetes, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Family history plays a role too, but lifestyle changes can significantly reduce your risk even with genetic predisposition. Our cardiologists recommend regular checkups to monitor these factors, especially after age 40. Remember that small changes make a big difference—adding physical activity to your routine, reducing sodium intake, or quitting smoking can dramatically improve your heart health outcomes. Schedule your comprehensive heart risk assessment today and take the first step toward a healthier heart."
