Nutrition plays a crucial role in heart health, but conflicting information can make it difficult to know what to eat. Our cardiac nutritionists have compiled evidence-based recommendations that go beyond the basics.
The Mediterranean diet continues to demonstrate impressive benefits for cardiovascular health. Rich in olive oil, nuts, fish, whole grains, and fresh produce, this eating pattern reduces inflammation and improves cholesterol profiles. Studies show it can reduce heart attack and stroke risk by up to 30%.
Some surprising foods with heart benefits include dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa), which contains flavonoids that improve blood flow; berries, which are packed with antioxidants that reduce inflammation; and fermented foods like yogurt, which support gut health linked to lower blood pressure.
Timing matters too—intermittent fasting approaches have shown promising results for heart health by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation.
Remember that individual needs vary. Our clinic offers personalized nutrition consultations to develop eating plans tailored to your specific cardiac concerns, preferences, and lifestyle.
